doesn't accept numbers abstract base classes. Until numbers will be
supported users have to define their own typing data for general number
classes. PEP 3141 recommends users to simply annotate arguments with
'float', but this wouldn't include `fractions.Fraction` which is often
necessary in musical contexts (as github user arseniiv also remarked)."""
